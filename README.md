# sharedRedream
POC to study and practice API development with Laravel 8.x

The API simulates a crowdfunding bussiness where you need to reedem to share.

- The user can ~~create an incident~~ share a dream
- The user needs to reedem a voucher to get money
- Once you get the money you can start to help others to realize their dreams
- Yeah, now you got the idea of sharedReDREAM :star2:
